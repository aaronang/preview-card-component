# Preview Card Component

This is a solution to the [3-column preview card component challenge on Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/3column-preview-card-component-pH92eAR2-).

Observations from working on the Preview Card component:

- In a previous challenge, I worked off an image of the design, which was quite tedious. It was much faster to copy the design in Figma and then work off the Figma design.
- There is this slightly weird transition when the viewport width is 925px wide. What happens at this point is that the paragraph text for each card does not cover the same number of lines, causing a misalignment in the buttons. One way to solve this is by fixing the height and position the button at the bottom. I would love to know about better approaches to solve this misalignment.
- I decided to deviate from the design slightly. I changed the paragraph transparency to 90% instead of 75% for better legibility. If this were a real working situation, I would have reached out to the designer and asked for their rationale. Similarly, I noticed that the preview card was not vertically centered. I don't know why it wasn't vertically centered and would have probably started a discussion with the designer to better understand their rationale.

I'd love to hear your thoughts and recommendations on how to improve this.
