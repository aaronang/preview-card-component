# Preview Card Component

This is a solution to the [3-column preview card component challenge on Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/3column-preview-card-component-pH92eAR2-).

Observations from working on the Preview Card component:

- In a previous challenge, I worked off an image of the design, which was quite tedious. It was much faster to copy the design in Figma and then work off the Figma design.
- There is this weird transition when the viewport-width is 925px. What happens at this point is that the paragraph text for each card does not cover the same number of lines, causing a misalignment in the buttons. One way to solve this is by fixing the height and position the button at the bottom. I would love to know about better approaches to solving this misalignment.
- I decided to slightly deviate from the design. I changed the paragraph transparency to 90% instead of 75% for better legibility. I also decided to vertically center the preview card. In a real-world situation, I would have reached out to the designer and asked for their rationale.

I'd love to hear your thoughts and recommendations on how to improve this.
